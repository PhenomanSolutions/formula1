[NOTE]
As we are using Angular and ofcourse we need to download angular templates, 
it is impossible to do it by only clicking on index.html as it will cause CrossOrigin exception

[HOW TO USE]
To use application application needs just any server, it dousn't need a back end to work, 
as it is using "http://ergast.com" as API
application also published on my azure machine with my own domain as: 

http://f1.phenomansolutions.com/ or http://formulaapp.azurewebsites.net/
